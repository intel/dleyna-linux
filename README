Introduction:
-------------

Dleyna-linux is an umbrella project, hosting a number of DLNA middleware
components as git submodules:

git://github.com/01org/dleyna-core.git
git://github.com/01org/dleyna-connector-dbus.git
git://github.com/01org/dleyna-server.git
git://github.com/01org/dleyna-renderer.git
git://github.com/01org/dleyna-control.git

Submodules contents are meant to be read-only to ensure consistency
between the various components.

The project is targeting the linux platform, using d-bus as the IPC
mechanism for client applications to access its services.

See each submodule documentation for details.


Compilation
------------

Dleyna-linux is built using autotools and gcc.  It also has a
number of dependencies on third party libraries, notably glib, gupnp,
gssdp and gupnp-av.  Both development versions of these libraries
and autotools need to be installed before dleyna-linux can be
compiled.  On Ubuntu 14.04 autotools and the glib development libraries can
be installed with the following commands.

sudo apt-get install autoconf
sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev

The development version of d-Bus is also required.  This can be
installed on Ubuntu by typing:

sudo apt-get install libdbus-1-dev

To install the necessary gupnp development versions, type:

sudo apt-get install libgupnp-av-1.0-dev
sudo apt-get install libgupnp-dlna-2.0-dev


Working with the source code repository
---------------------------------------

Dleyna-linux can be downloaded, compiled and installed as
follows:

   Clone repository
     # git clone git://github.com/01org/dleyna-linux.git
     # cd dleyna-linux

   Update submodules
     # git submodule init
     # git submodule update

   Configure and build
     # ./autogen.sh
     # make

   Final installation
     # sudo make install

These instructions are suitable for users who simply want to install
dleyna-linux services.  However, developers wishing to contribute
to the project should follow a separate "Configure and build" step.

   Configure and build
     # ./bootstrap-configure
     # make

The script "bootstrap-configure" cleans the repository, calls
autreconf and then invokes configure with proper settings for
development.  These settings include the enabling of
maintainer mode and debugging.

Developers can remove autogenerated files with the following command

     # make maintainer-clean
